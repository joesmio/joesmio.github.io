![Profile Image]({{ site.picture }}){: style="float: left;margin-right: 1em;"}


I am a postdoctoral research associate in [QET Labs](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/qet-labs/) at the University of Bristol designing silicon chips to connect and control single spins.

My research looks to create useful applications from lab demonstrations with the injection of technologies. One target is answering whether single atom-like defects in solids can be controlled at scale, by borrowing existing semiconductor processing tools.

My recent [work](/papers.md) focussed on embedding atom-like systems in photonics, demonstrating compatibility with silicon photonics.

I am also interested in RF engineering, specifically for quantum spin manipulation, and am Co-I on a UK [Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub](https://www.qcshub.org/) Partnership Resource to integrate atom-like systems with silicon electronics.

My aim is to put photonics and electronics front and centre: with useful applications in adding spins to photonic quantum computing and networks, but also for more near-term implications of high resolution imaging and sensing.
