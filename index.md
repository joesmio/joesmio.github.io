![Profile Image]({{ site.picture }}){: style="float: center"}

I am a postdoc in [QET Labs at the University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Joe-Smith-acb28703-28ff-44b0-8929-ff449fb7e979/) designing silicon chips to connect and control single spins.

My research looks to create useful applications from lab demonstrations with the injection of technologies. One target is answering whether single atom-like defects in solids can be controlled at scale, by borrowing existing semiconductor processing tools.

Our recent [work](/papers.md) focusses on embedding atom-like systems in photonics, demonstrating compatibility with silicon photonics, and advancing quantum sensing using robotics. I am also interested in RF engineering, specifically for quantum spin manipulation.

My aim is to put photonics and electronics front and centre: with useful applications in adding spins to photonic quantum computing and networks, but also for more near-term implications for high resolution quantum sensing. I am currently Researcher Co-Investigator and budget holder of a three year project called [QC:SCALE - Quantum Circuits: Systematically Controlling And Linking Emitters for integrated solid state photonics platforms](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/W006685/1) where we are developing technology to integrate atom-like systems with silicon electronics and photonics.
